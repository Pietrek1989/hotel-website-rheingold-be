# Haus Rheingold hotel

Our project is an innovative hotel booking platform that marries convenience, functionality, and style. It offers a seamless user interface featuring a custom-made calendar that smartly displays only the available rooms on any chosen date, eliminating the often frustrating process of navigating through fully booked options.

Our website streamlines the booking process, making it as straightforward and efficient as possible. The integrated Stripe payment solution allows for secure and hassle-free transactions, ensuring peace of mind for all users.

But that's not all; we've developed an intuitive back-office system for admins, enabling them to keep a pulse on business operations. This includes tracking earnings, examining reservation details, issuing refunds, updating room images, and making necessary edits.

In line with the latest digital trends, our platform offers a dark mode option for enhanced usability, especially during nighttime browsing. To experience our platform's full suite of capabilities, feel free to contact me to get an admin account and access backoffice.
